# DBitch contains useful utilities for manipulating the GarbagÃ© 
# server database. It's essentially a big bundle of shortcuts I've written for 
# you. Be happy. Please initialize this class with the database you'd like to 
# work with. Don't worry, you can always change to a different one later. This 
# should be a string describing the filepath relative to the application where 
# the databse is located. Something like: './mammas_recipes.db'. BE AWARE: If 
# the DB don't exist already, this will create it.
#
# Examples
#
#   myDBitch = DBitch.new(dbname)
#   # => Daybreak::DB
#
#   DBitch.load_DB(dbname)
#   # => Daybreak::DB
#
#   DBitch.get_DB
#   # => Daybreak::DB
#
#   DBitch.add_log(Log)
#   # => true
#   myDBitch.get_timestamp_hash(timestamp)
#   # => {:happy => 42, :ennui => 42, :sad => 42, :angry => 42, 
#   :upset => 42, :content => 42, :regretful => 42, :lonely =>
